- Would be cool to also show the list of cards in the deck and discard pile for debugging purposes
- Would be cool to create ui "boxes" that I could display text in that wrapped if the displayed text was too long.
	- that way I could have vertical sections of the screen dedicated to different things. Far left could be the current hand, middle could be discard, idk.
	- Or I could just use an actual TUI library at that point
